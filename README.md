# üéÆ BeyondPlatformerLimits: 2D Fly Hack Exploration

"BeyondPlatformerLimits" epitomizes the intersection of gaming and technical expertise. More than a game hack, it's a testament to perseverance, deep technical knowledge, and the will to redefine gameplay boundaries. This project demonstrates the capabilities of C++ and the Windows API, specifically targeting the Cheat Engine 7.5's game tutorial (lvl 3).

## üöÄ Project Overview:

- **Language & Tools**: Developed in C++, "BeyondPlatformerLimits" showcases the power of the language combined with the Windows API. 
- **Memory Manipulation**: The project provides a fresh perspective on 2D platformer gameplay by manipulating game memory.
- **Deep Dive into Pointers**: Through multi-level pointers and intricate memory addresses, this project unveils the intricacies of low-level programming and how game mechanics work under the hood.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights:

- **Multi-Level Pointers**: Navigate game memory with proficiency. By adeptly moving through pointer chains, the code pinpoints memory addresses that dictate gameplay.
- **Windows API Mastery**: Interact directly with process memory using the Windows.h library. Functions like `GetProcessID`, `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot`, and `ReadProcessMemory` are expertly employed.
- **Code Structure & Commenting**: The code is structured optimally for readability and accessibility. Detailed comments make complex operations easy to understand.
- **Ethical Game Hacking**: Push boundaries while maintaining respect for the gaming community.

## ü§î Challenges & Struggles:

- **Pointer Discovery**: The challenge was to identify a consistent multi-level pointer across different systems. This involved testing numerous pointers with Cheat Engine's pointer scans.
- **Design**: The project's design is complex yet optimized. Crafting it from scratch required deep attention to detail.
- **Data Types & Memory Management**: Managing and implementing various data types was crucial, especially when interfacing with memory.
- **Debugging & Issue Resolution**: Numerous bugs and challenges arose that demanded patience, perseverance, and deep understanding.
